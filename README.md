## Overview
This project is written in Python Language. We define custom class called "function" to handle dynamic function creation and calculation. All the algorithims used to solve the non-linear equation are also defined as methods in that class.
## How to reproduce
1. If you haven't installed pip yet, just run the file get-pip.py and it will be automatically downloaded.
2. We need to download pymep package to parse and eval function
```bash
pip install pymep
```
3. Now you're ready to run this project.
